        <p class="txt">
          Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. With an
          official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January
          2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the
          fifth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most
          densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th
          century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance,
          diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, gastronomy and many areas. For
          its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and
          extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became

          The best time to visit Paris? Not August The myth that everything in
          Europe shuts down in August is not a myth at all and totally happens
          -- especially in countries like Italy, Spain, and you guessed it,
          France. Most locals leave for vacation this month, and many
          restaurants and small businesses stay closed for weeks at a time. But
          truthfully, every month in Paris has its perks -- even August, if
          avoiding large crowds of Parisians actually sounds appealing to you.
          Winters aren’t too cold, and Paris during Christmas time is straight
          out of a movie. And of course, Paris in the springtime is hard to
          beat.

          Not Always Called Tokyo Until 1868, Tokyo was actually called Edo.
          Prior to this, the capital of Japan was considered to be what is now
          modern day Kyoto. In 1868, the home of the Emperor and Seat of the
          Government of Japan were moved to Edo. This city was then renamed
          Tokyo and declared the nations new capital. Tokyo was once a small
          fishing village called Edo. Founded in 1603, it eventually became the
          seat of the Tokugawa shogunate but it was known as Edo until the 19th
          century. In 1890 during the Meiji Restoration, it became Toyo, which
          means ‘Eastern Capital’ in English. No official rules have actually
          made Tokyo the capital of Japan.
