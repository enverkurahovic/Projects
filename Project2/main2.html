        <h1 class="h1">Paris</h1>
        <p class="txt">
          Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. With an
          official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January
          2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the
          fifth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most
          densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th
          century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance,
          diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, gastronomy and many areas. For
          its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and
          extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became
          known as the City of Light.[7]

          Thinking of heading to Paris for the first time, the fifth time, or
          the thousandth time? Well, I’m sure that there are plenty of things
          you may well not have considered, but that you totally need to know!
          From the best time to visit the city to exploring off the beaten path,
          here are some Paris travel tips you need to know before visiting.
          First time in Paris? If you’re reading this guide to my very best
          Paris tips (as someone who has lived in Paris for over three years),
          then it may well be your first time planning a trip to Paris. However,
          no need to worry… We’ve all been there! It’s our first time in a new
          city and we have no clue where we’re going, let alone the language,
          which, in this case, is French. This travel guide is here to help you
          navigate your first time in Paris. And, if you’re short on time, then
          I have several quick tips to know before you read the rest of the
          article. One of the main things to know before your first Paris trip
          are to make sure you leave Paris at least once (there’s a whole load
          of France worth exploring outside of the city). Some of the best day
          trips from the city include to Versailles, Fontainebleau, Sceaux, and
          Giverny. Next, the metro is the fastest and cheapest way to get around
          the city. The Parisian metro is one of the oldest and most extensive
          in the world. It also happens to be one of the cheapest ways to get
          from A to B in the capital city. If you buy a ‘carnet’ which is when
          you buy a book of ten metro tickets at once, it’ll cost under €1.70 a
          journey! If you opt to buy the ‘Easy Navigo,’ which you can buy at any
          station office (where there is an employee working), each journey will
          only cost €1.49. Lastly, before we delve into the truly nitty gritty
          details that you should be aware of before visiting, be sure not to
          fall prey to any tourist scams, never buy bottled water at a
          restaurant (tap water is free- just ask for a ‘carafe’ of water at the
          restaurant), and be sure to learn a few simple French phrases before
          you go! You can buy a French phrasebook like this one to help you out.
